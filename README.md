## Rules of the game
Start of the game: All cards are face down. Players do not see the images and do not know where which images are located.
Move: Each player turns over two cards in turn. If the images on them match, the player takes this pair for himself and can make another move. If the images do not match, the cards are turned face down again and the turn passes to the next player.
Memorization: The players' task is to remember the location of the turned over cards in order to find pairs in subsequent turns.
Victory: The game continues until all pairs have been found. The player who collects the most pairs wins.
